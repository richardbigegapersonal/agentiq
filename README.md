## 🚀 Quickstart
### 1. Clone and Configure
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentiq.git
cd agentiq
cp .env.example .env  # then fill in API keys
```

### 2. Run Locally with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Access the App
- FastAPI: http://localhost:8000/query
- Streamlit: http://localhost:8501

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables
Add your secrets to a `.env` file (excluded from Git):
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
PINECONE_API_KEY=...
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

---

## 🧠 LangSmith Tracing
AgentIQ uses LangSmith to trace LLM input/output, token usage, and error patterns.
```python
from tracing.langsmith_hooks import tracer
chain.run("question", callbacks=[tracer])
```

Set up your LangSmith API key in the environment as needed.

---

## 🔁 GitHub Actions CI/CD
AgentIQ auto-builds Docker images on every push to `main`. Add the following secrets:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

---

## 🌍 Deployment to Render
Create a new **Web Service** at [Render](https://dashboard.render.com):
- Build Command: `docker-compose build`
- Start Command: `docker-compose up`
- Set env vars: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`

Expose port `8000` (API) and `8501` (Streamlit).
